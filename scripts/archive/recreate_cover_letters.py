Dear Hiring Manager,

As a platform-focused Product Manager with over six years of experience in B2B SaaS, I have spent my career stabilizing and maintaining data-intensive systems that support revenue. I am drawn to {display_company} because of your mission to deliver best-in-class product experiences. My background in managing complex data ingestion pipelines, legacy platform modernization, and cross-functional alignment makes me a strong fit to own the core systems and integrations that power your platform.

At Cision, I managed the C3 platform and CPRE infrastructure, where I was responsible for the product roadmap and cross-functional alignment for a $40M ARR ecosystem. I operate at the intersection of business and engineering, having driven initiatives like "Bellwether"—an architectural bypass of legacy ETL pipelines that addressed a primary churn driver by improving data freshness. I am experienced in working with SQL and debugging complex system issues, which allows me to partner effectively with engineering teams to ship reliable solutions. My approach is pragmatic: I prioritize stability and data quality as foundational product features, ensuring that internal operations teams have the reliable tools they need to succeed.

I thrive in environments where I can translate technical constraints into clear product roadmaps. Whether it is resolving a 90% security backlog or consolidating fragmented content ingestion into a unified source of truth, I focus on reducing manual friction and improving system reliability. I understand the nuances of operating in complex environments and am eager to apply my experience in data architecture and platform ownership to help {display_company} scale its event intelligence capabilities.

I am interested in the opportunity to contribute to the {display_company} team and would welcome the chance to discuss how my experience in platform stability and data-intensive product management aligns with your goals for the core platform. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Jason Taylor
