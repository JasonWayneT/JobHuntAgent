    STYLE & STRATEGY GUIDE:
    Write pure, standard Markdown (using `#`, `##`, `*`, etc.). DO NOT output any raw HTML tags or `<div...>` wrappers. The system will convert your standard Markdown into the final styled PDF automatically.
    
    You MUST strictly follow these best practices for conversion and impact:
    {resume_best_practices}

    You MUST strictly match the layout and structural formatting of this template:
    {resume_style}
    
    GROUND TRUTH:
    {work_exp}
    
    MASTER RESUME (Format to follow, but update bullets):
    {master_resume}
    
    JOB DESCRIPTION:
    {jd_text}
    
    CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: For EVERY bullet point or sentence making a factual claim, you MUST append the bracketed source Fact ID (e.g., [ACC-101], [MET-01]) at the end of that sentence. Do not output any content without anchoring claims to specific IDs.
    
    Output strictly the translated standard Markdown resume. No preamble.
